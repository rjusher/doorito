# PEP NNNN: Title of the Enhancement — Discussions

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **PEP** | NNNN |
| **Summary** | [summary.md](summary.md) |

<!--
OPTIONAL FILE — include only when the PEP has genuine design tensions, unresolved
questions, or non-obvious trade-offs. Skip for straightforward additive PEPs.

This file captures design discussions, answered questions, and decisions made
throughout the PEP lifecycle. It provides a structured record so that future
sessions and contributors understand WHY choices were made.

RULES:
- Record resolved questions with date, answer, and rationale
- Record design decisions with context and alternatives rejected
- Keep "Open Threads" for active discussions not yet resolved (this is the single
  canonical place for unresolved questions — do NOT put them in the summary)
- Never delete entries — append new answers and decisions chronologically
-->

## Resolved Questions

<!--
When an Open Thread is resolved, move it here with the date, answer, and rationale.

FORMAT:
### Q: The original question?
- **Resolved**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Answer**: The decision that was made
- **Rationale**: Why this answer was chosen over alternatives
-->

## Design Decisions

<!--
Record significant design decisions made during planning or implementation.
These are decisions that aren't obvious from the code and would be useful
for future contributors to understand.

FORMAT:
### Decision: Short description
- **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Context**: What prompted this decision
- **Decision**: What was decided
- **Alternatives rejected**: What other options were considered and why they were rejected
-->

## Open Threads

<!--
Active discussions not yet resolved. Move to "Resolved Questions" or
"Design Decisions" once a conclusion is reached.

FORMAT:
### Thread: Short description
- **Raised**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Context**: What needs to be discussed
- **Options**: List of possible approaches
