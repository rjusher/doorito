# PEP NNNN: Title of the Enhancement — Implementation Journal

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **PEP** | NNNN |
| **Summary** | [summary.md](summary.md) |
| **Plan** | [plan.md](plan.md) |

<!--
OPTIONAL FILE — create only when implementation spans multiple sessions.
Do NOT pre-populate with an empty template at planning time.

This journal is a running log of implementation progress. Agents append entries
as they work, capturing what was done, decisions made, and blockers encountered.

PURPOSE: When an agent session is interrupted (context limit, user stops, crash),
the next session reads this journal to resume with full context — no re-exploration needed.

RULES:
- Append new entries at the bottom (chronological order)
- Never delete or modify previous entries
- Each entry should note which step(s) from the plan were worked on
- Record decisions with rationale so future sessions don't revisit them
- Flag blockers clearly so the next session knows where to pick up

ENTRY FORMAT:
## YYYY-MM-DD — Session N

### Step X: Description (status: done / partial / blocked)
- What was done
- Decisions made and why
- Files created/modified
- Issues encountered

### Left Off
- **Last completed step**: Step N (verified)
- **Next step**: Step N+1 — Brief description of what to do
- **Blockers**: None / Description of what's blocking
- **Uncommitted work**: None / List of files with partial changes not yet working
