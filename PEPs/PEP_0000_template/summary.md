## Problem Statement

<!--
Clearly describe the problem this PEP addresses.
- What is the current behavior?
- Why is it insufficient?
- Who is affected?
Keep this concise but specific enough that a reader understands the motivation.
-->

## Proposed Solution

<!--
Describe the proposed solution at a high level.
- What will change?
- How will it work from the user's perspective?

-->

## Rationale

<!--
Explain why this solution was chosen over alternatives.
- What design decisions were made?
- What trade-offs were considered?
- How does this align with the project's architecture?
-->

## Alternatives Considered

<!--

- Services: (list affected services)
- Admin: (list affected admin modules)
- CLI: (list affected CLI commands)
- Tasks: (list affected Celery tasks)

## Out of Scope

<!--
Explicitly list what this PEP does NOT cover. This prevents over-engineering and scope creep
during implementation. If something is deferred to a future PEP, reference it.

- Feature or behavior that is NOT part of this PEP
- Adjacent functionality deferred to PEP NNNN
- Edge cases intentionally not handled (and why)
-->

## Acceptance Criteria

<!--
List specific, testable criteria that must be met for this PEP to be considered implemented.

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3
-->

## Status History

<!--
Track lifecycle transitions for traceability.
